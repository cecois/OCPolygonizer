This project is ostensibly about semantically parsing arbitrary prose using the OpenCalais API from Thomson-Reuters and storing spatial polygons associated with the results. It is very young and very rigid and it likely makes no sense for you to fork it at this point. That said, if you are able to wade through the code you'll find that we're at the very least able to submit to and parse from OpenCalais, resolve through linked data to Freebase shapes, and in fact are preparing to offer backup sources for polygons as well.
